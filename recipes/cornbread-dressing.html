    <h1>Grandma's Cornbread Dressing</h1>
    <img src="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/19547/grandmas-corn-bread-dressing/" />
    <p>This cornbread dressing recipe is from my grandmother. She loved to make it for holiday dinners and for family gatherings at other times of the year. Use your favorite cornbread mix to make a batch of cornbread, and then crumble it for use in this family-favorite recipe. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>· Cornbread: This recipe starts with crumbled cornbread. You can buy pre-made cornbread, make it from a mix, or make a from-scratch cornbread recipe.</ul>
        <ul>· Vegetables: You'll need diced onions and celery.</ul>
        <ul>· Butter: Butter is used to saute the fresh vegetables.</ul>
        <ul>· Eggs: Two eggs add moisture and richness. They also act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dressing together.</ul>
        <ul>· Stock: Use store-bought or homemade chicken stock for more flavor and moisture.</ul>
        <ul>· Seasonings: This cornbread dressing is seasoned with dried sage, salt, and black pepper. Of course, you can adjust the seasonings to taste.</ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>1. Sauté the vegetables in butter until soft.</ol>
        <ol>2. Add the sautéed vegetables to the crumbled cornbread.</ol>
        <ol>3. Stir in the remaining ingredients and mix until well-combined.</ol>
        <ol>4. Transfer the dressing to a prepared baking dish and bake until golden brown.</ol>
